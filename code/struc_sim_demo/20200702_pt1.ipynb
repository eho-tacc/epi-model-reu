    "____\n",
    "In the [sequence similarity demo](../seq_sim_demo/20200706_seq_sim.ipynb), we explored the differences in the primary sequence (amino acid sequence) of TMPRSS2 between human and other animal homologs. We identified some amino acid properties (amino acid volume, hydrophobicity, charge/acidity) and constructed an algorithm for determining if a mutation at a single site has a large, moderate, or minimal effect, based on changes in these properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is natural to ask the question: **why do these amino acid properties matter, and how does changing these properties affect the structure and function of the protein?** This is the question we will be answering in this structural similarity demo. We will split this question into 2-3 separate parts:\n",
    "1. Qualitatively explore how amino acid properties affect 2ยบ and 3ยบ structure of the protein, and how they might affect function.\n",
    "2. Develop a semi-quantitative model that explains how single site amino acid mutations could affect the overall function of the TMPRSS2 protein, compared to the human homolog. We will do this by extending the sequence iterator algorithm that we developed in the [sequence similarity demo](../seq_sim_demo/20200706_seq_sim.ipynb).\n",
    "3. **Optional**: compare our semi-quantitative model to other variant -> function models in the literature, such as [SIFT](http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index) and [PhyreRisk](http://phyrerisk.bc.ic.ac.uk/search?action=fresh-search&searchTerm=O15393)."

    "In the [sequence similarity demo](../seq_sim_demo/20200706_seq_sim.ipynb), we compiled a list of residues that the literature implicates as important in binding and cleaving the S protein. These residues include the catalytic triad (H296, D345 and S441) and important binding residues (D435, K223, and K224).\n",

In the [sequence similarity demo](../seq_sim_demo/20200706_seq_sim.ipynb), we were looking at the sequence of isoform 2, so we had to adjust these positions by 37 amino acids. Here, we are looking a the sequence of isoform 1, so we do not need to make this adjustment. `nglview` also uses the standard 1-indexing for residue numbering, so we do not need to subtract 1 to get the index in a 0-indexed list, like we did for the [sequence similarity demo](../seq_sim_demo/20200706_seq_sim.ipynb).\n",
