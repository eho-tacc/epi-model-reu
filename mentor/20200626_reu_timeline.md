## Program Week Calendar

1. Week 3-4 (June 22 - July 3): _2 weeks_
    * Write a specific hypothesis
    * Define explicit experimental approach
2. Week 5-7 (July 6 - 24): _3 weeks_
    * Data analysis
    * Flesh out experimental approach
3. Week 8-9 (July 27 - August 7): _2 weeks_
    * Work on presentation
    * Defend hypothesis and approach
    * Finalize write-up

## Timeline of Analysis

### Analysis Summary

1. Align homologous protein sequences
2. How many residues of interest are conserved between basis (human) and homologs?
3. Other optional directions
    1. Phylogeny: how has TMPRSS2 evolved within mammals?
    2. Struture: for each mutated site, is the mutation neutral, positive, or negative?
    3. Repeat 1 & 2 _within_ human population

### Software Skills Summary

1. Learn data science software stack
    * Jupyter
    * Python
    * pandas
2. Alignment tools
    * BLASTp
    * Bio.AlignIO and Bio.pairwise2
3. Domain-specific tools
    1. Phylogeny: ???
    2. Structure
        * Pymol
        * Third-party SSM -> function tools: Phyre2, POLYPHEN, PROVEAN, etc.
    3. Human
        * Mining human genome DB
        * Otherwise, same stack as 1 & 2

### Timeline (for both)

1. End of week 5
    * Time estimate: 1 week
    * But some lag time before to finish up literature review, intro to Python, pandas, etc.
2. End of week 6: 1 week
3. End of week 7
    1. Phylogeny: 1 week
    2. Struture: 1 week
    3. Human population: 2 weeks

## Weekly Tasks

* Present progress since last week
* Journal club: take turns reviewing 1 paper a week
* New software tool: a new bioinformatics tool, Python library, etc.
