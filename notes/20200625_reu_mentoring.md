* Project ideas: Kelly
    * Are pets dead-end spillover hosts or infectious hosts?
    * How does variabiligy in SARS-CoV-2 phylogenic subtypes drive transmission?
        * Is it possible to tease out effect of viral phenotype from an observed R(t)?
        * How about metrics other than R(0) and R(t)?

### COVID in Domestic Animals

* [Cats in Wuhan test positive by serological test](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.021196v1.abstract)
    * n = 102
    * Neutralization titers were higher for cats with COVID-19 positive owners than for hospital or stray cats
* [SCV-1 disease progression in cats and ferrets (2003)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094990/)
    * We **could** assume that incubation/recovery periods in cats are the same in SARS-CoV-2 and SCV

    * In their opinion: "There is currently no evidence that cats can spread COVID‐19 and owners should not abandon their pets or compromise their welfare."
    * There is no evidence for cats being infectious hosts as of yet.

    * Airborne transmission between domestic cats is possible
    * Dogs have reduced susceptibility
    * "Ferrets and cats differ by only two amino acids in the SARS-CoV-2 spike-contacting regions of ACE2 (table S1); therefore, the underlying mechanism that prevents the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the lower respiratory tract of ferrets (but not cats) remains to be investigated."

    * After viral S protein binding host ACE2 receptor, these serine proteases (TMPRSSs) cleave the S protein resulting in host cell membrane fusion.

#### Takeaways

* Many non-human animals such as ferrets, cats, and bats are capable of serving as infectious intermediate hosts.
* Concerning domesticated animals, cats and ferrets appear to be the most susceptible to infection.
* Dogs appear to be less susceptible.
* Little population-scale data on transmission in domesticated animals, as far as I'm aware.
* Potential idea: extrapolate on the [Damas et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7263403/) homology study
    * The Damas study uses a multi-faceted approach to computing the risk score. There are also simpler "score" analyses that are cited in the Damas paper.
    * Replicate the "susceptibilty score" calculation, but for a different disease target
    * What is the sequence homology of TMPRSSs between different mammals? Would the risk score for a given species be the same for ACE2 and TMPRSS?
